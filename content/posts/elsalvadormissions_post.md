Our church recently went on a medical missions trip to El Salvador for a week. I was able to see and experience many different things that I was unable to realize before.

Of all the many things I experienced, one thing in particular stuck out to me. As I was serving as an assistant in the medical team, I was able to observe the true condition of the world around me that I had never seen before. The carefree me who had been, in a sense, shielded by the comforts of modern society at home came to realize the harsh reality of life in this world. Many people who came in were suffering from various medical conditions, but one particular one came into my attention more often than I wanted.

My sister is a Type 1 Diabetic and as a result, I am quite sensitive and empathetic to those with similar conditions. During this particular missions trip, I was able to realize nearly a third of the people that were screened in were diabetic, with a great portion of them also suffering from numerous other uncurable and life-threatening diseases. One lady in particular stuck out to me; she had lost a leg due to a diabetes related amputation, but oblivious to her diabetic condition, she continued to sip on a coconut with a blood sugar reading of 412 mg/dL. It really broke my heart when I was able to make out through my broken high school spanish that the woman's son wanted to ask the family doctor in our team why her mother had lost her leg.

Coming back to the US, I am thankful once again for being able to live in a society where most people can receive proper medical care. My experiences in El Salvador left me with a new world view on the issue of unaccessible medical care in the globe. The statement that more than half of the 8 billion people in this world are unable to receive proper medical coverage was no longer just a statistic, but has become a painful reality. I have always thought that most diseases would end with the production of a cure or a treatment method. However, what this world needs beyond just a method of treatment is a widely accessible and affordable form of healthcare. It is my personal hope that one day everyone in the world is able to receive the proper healthcare they deserve, starting with diabetic awareness in El Salvador.
