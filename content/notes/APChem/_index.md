The following notes were taken in 2023-2024 School year and should be noted to be in accordance with the AP curriculum that year. If anything is missing due to modifications in the AP exam in subsequent years, please let me know so I can update it. If you have any questions regarding the material, feel free to reach out to me (I got a 5 on the exam!ðŸ˜‹).

> Shout out to Mr. Raimondo from C.G. Woodson High School for providing the awesome class in which I took these notes! If you would like to reach out to him for any questions regarding the class: roraimondo@fcps.edu
