I enjoy taking personal notes during class and decorating them to have a complete piece of study material afterwards. Below are some of the notes I have taken in a few of my classes. Feel free to use them to help you study, but use them solely as a guide (there are many better reference materials out there ðŸ˜…). If there are any inaccuracies that you would like to let me know or any additions that should be made please email me at: isaackim626@gmail.com
